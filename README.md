# Features:
- DarkSystem is **# 1** about speed. (We think so)
- Loads chunks region-to-region. It uses less CPU resources & loads chunks fast.
- MobAI Support (Some animals and mobs can move & attack)
- Smooth Movement (Players does not glitch or go down (:D) and while move does not throw back.)
- Support **PIZZA!** :D (/givepizza [player] | if you write only /givepizza, will give pizza everyone) (Pizza mark can be changed from advanced config.)
- Colored & Clean Console (Console is really so clean, does not send junk messages like plugin enabling, XBOX offline mode warn. etc.)
- AntiForceOP (Hackers cannot access to OP command, you are in safe :))
- CustomUI (Allows to create customizable menus, can be added by /addui) (+1.2)
- Code is clean, fast and safe, coded as DarkSystem php code method.
- More Commands (/clear, /tpall, /clearchat /addui etc.)
- Advanced Config **(pocketmine_advanced.yml)**
- DarkBot (Virtual Intelligent Bot; Can talk, help players, move etc.) (say "hi darkbot" ingame :))
