### DarkSystem Special Android APP is Out!
You can download it [here](http://bit.do/darksystem_apk).<br>
**NOTE:** Language of app is Turkish, does not support English. Will be added soon.<br>

**We may have language problems :)**

# Features:
- DarkSystem is **# 1** about speed & no-lag. (We think so)
- Based on **old** PocketMine-MP for best performance and stability.
- Loads chunks region-to-region. It uses less CPU resources & loads chunks fast.
- Cached chunk loading (Loads chunks and levels with cache for speed.)
- MobAI Support (Almost all mobs can move & attack) (Support Attacking Movement)
- Smooth Movement (Players don't glitch or clip through the floor (if they are not in 1.2) while moving and does not throw them back.)
- MCPE 1.2 Support (DarkSystem is compatible with MC: Bedrock Edition/Better together update (aka 1.2))
- Auto Updater (DarkSystem is automatically updated from GitHub.) (!!! Not implemented yet !!!)
- More Biomes & Advanced Generator (DarkSystem supports more biomes than others softwares, loads levels fast)
- Anti-BOT (Bot Protection) (Blocks joining of MCPE Bots from same ip. Ex. MineBot)
- Anti-COOP Play (Like bot protection)
- Themes! (You can change theme in **server.properties**. Available themes: classic, dark, light, metal, energy, uranium)
- Ender Biome Support (No description :D)
- Advanced Fly Checker (Can be activated from config. May cause lag when moving. Checks if player is in the air better.)
- No Bad Packets! (Players only can send a few packets before logging in. Only LoginPacket, Resource and Behavior packs packets, and 1-2 required packets. Blocks AdventureSettingsPacket and SetPlayerGameType packet. Cool!)
- **InventoryAPI!** (You can create customizable virtual inventories!) (**InventoryAPI::createInventory(...)**)
- /ping Command (Allows to get quality of player's connection)
- /xyz Command (Allows to get players position)
- /createinv Command (Allows to open virtual inventories)
- Custom 1.2 and WIN10 Inventories (No Bug)
- More Mobs/Entities (Support Parrot, NPC, Chalkboard, LearnToCodeMascot and many more)
- Extended Plugin API (It is an api called as DarkAPI :D lol) (Support Compound & CompoundTag etc.)
- Compatible with newest plugins (API 3.x.x)
- Custom Query (When server starts, sets up a mySQL connection to specified host from config. Can be disabled from **server.properties**)
- MySQLManager (You can send data to website of your server about players' kills, deaths, money etc. quickly.) (**utils\MySQLManager**)
- If you want to have a fast cool and safe (Don't forget 'fast' :)) server, use DarkSystem!
- Colored & Clean Console (Console is really clean, does not send junk messages like plugin enabling, XBOX offline mode warn. etc.)
- AntiForceOP (Hackers cannot access to OP command, you are in safe :))
- Floating Text as Entity (On DarkSystem, floating text isn't a particle, it is an entity. So it blocks floating text hack or other. Also dissappearing floating texts is impossible.)
- Auto Lag Cleaner (How does it work? It automatically removes items and arrows from ground without occuping CPU.)
- Weather (Supports snow/rain/thunder)
- **DarkRCON!** (NOT PUBLISHED YET!) (An advanced rcon client for managing DarkSystem servers. Fully protected with password. 100% safe. Works on Android, Windows And more...)
- CustomUI (Allows to create fully customizable menus, can be added by /addui) (only +1.2)
- /addui Command (You can easily test CustomUIs with this) (/addui {player} {type:shop/alert/image/slider/dropdown/input/mix})
- Fully Turkish Language (DarkSystem Support %79 Turkish Language. How to set language to Turkish? Simple, choose language to **tur** on set-up wizard. After set **language:** to **tur** on **pocketmine.yml**) **Greek language comming soon**
- MultiVersionÂ® support (**What is this?** We support **1.0.x, 1.1.x and 1.2.x** versions of Minecraft (PE) Bedrock Edition)
- Always up-to-date. We always add new block, items to DarkSystem. You can always find new things here when they are out.
- No junk tasks/threads on background. Anything cannot occupy the CPU resources and performance.
- Zoom Support (indev) (May be useful for PvP servers. Simply write /zoom.)
- World Teleporting (/world) (You can teleport to another world without a plugin, only with a simple command!)
- TextUtils (Idea from MiNET, code taken from Turanic. Allows to create more beautiful texts. Example, **TextUtils::center($message)** makes message in center.)
- BlockLauncher join Blocking (indev) (If you hate hackers, this is for you. How to use? It is fully automatic. But not implemented yet. Doesn't work...YET)
- Code is clean, FAST and SAFE, coded in PHP.
- More & Advanced Commands (/clear, /tpall, /clearchat /addui /zoom /world /morph /xyz /cave /summon /chunkinfo /ping /createinv etc.)
- Advanced Config **(pocketmine_advanced.yml)**
- DarkBot (Virtual Intelligent Bot; It can talk, help players, move etc.) (say "hi darkbot" in-game to test :))

 * Piston (indev)
 * Banner (1.2 only)
 * Parrots (1.2 only)
