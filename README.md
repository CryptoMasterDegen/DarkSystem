**DarkSystem based on fun!**

# Features:
- DarkSystem is **# 1** about speed & no-lag. (We think so)
- Based on **old** PocketMine-MP for better performance and stability.
- Loads chunks region-to-region. It uses less CPU resources & loads chunks fast.
- Cached chunk loading (Loads chunks and levels with cache for speed.)
- MobAI Support (So many animals and mobs can move & attack) (Support Attacking Movement)
- Smooth Movement (Players do not glitch or go down (if not 1.2 :D) while moving and does not throw back.)
- MCPE 1.2 Support (DarkSystem is compatible with MC: Bedrock Edition/Better together update)
- Auto Updater (This is automatically updates DarkSystem from GitHub.) (!!! Not implemented yet !!!)
- More Biomes & Advanced Generator (Support more biomes than others, loads level fast)
- Anti-BOT (Bot Protection) (Blocks joining of MCPE Bots from same ip. Ex. MineBot)
- Anti-COOP Play (Like bot protection)
- Themes! (You can change theme from **server.properties**. Available themes: classic, dark, light, metal, energy, uranium)
- Ender Biome Support (No description :D)
- Advanced Fly Checker (Can be activated from config. May cause lag about moving. Checks is player on the air better.)
- No Bad Packets! (Players only can send a few packets before logging in. Only LoginPacket, Resource and Behavior packs packets, and 1-2 required packets. Blocks AdventureSettingsPacket and SetPlayerGameType packet. Cool!)

- Custom Query (When server starts, sets up a mySQL connection to specified host from config. Can be disabled from **server.properties**)
- MySQLManager (You can send datas to website of your server about players' kills, deaths, money etc. quickly.) (**utils\MySQLManager**)
- If you want to a cool and safe (Don't forget 'fast' :)) server, use DarkSystem!
- Support **PIZZA!** (/givepizza [player] | If you write only /givepizza, gives pizza everyone. NOTE: Our pizzas does not contain harmful substances lol :D) (Pizza mark can be changed from advanced config.)
- Colored & Clean Console (Console is really so clean, does not send junk messages like plugin enabling, XBOX offline mode warn. etc.)
- AntiForceOP (Hackers cannot access to OP command, you are in safe :))
- Floating Text as Entity (On DarkSystem, floating text is not a particle, it is an entity. So it blocks floating text hack or others. Also dissappearing of floating texts is not possible.)
- Auto Lag Cleaner (How does it works? It automatically removes items and arrows from ground without occuping CPU.)
- Weather (Supports snow/rain/thunder)
- **DarkRCON!** (NOT PUBLISHED YET!) (An advenced rcon client for managing DarkSystem servers. Fully protected with password. %100 safe. Works on Android, Windows And more...)

- /addui Command (You can easily test CustomUIs with this) (/addui {player} {type:shop/alert/image/slider/dropdown/input/mix})

- MultiVersionÂ® support (**What is this?** We support **1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.2.x** versions of Minecraft (PE) Bedrock Edition)
- Always up-to-date. We always add new block, items to DarkSystem. You can find new things here when out.
- No junk tasks/threads on background. Anything cannot occupy the CPU resources and performance.
- Zoom Support (indev) (Maybe useful for PvP servers. Simply write /zoom.)
- World Teleporting (/world) (You can teleport to another world without a plugin, only with a simple command!)
- TextUtils (Idea from MiNET, code taken from Turanic. Allows to create more beautiful texts. Example, **TextUtils::center($message)** makes message in center.)
- BlockLauncher join Blocking (indev) (If you hate hackers, this is for you. How to use? It is fully automatic. But not implemented yet. Does not work.)
- Code is clean, fast and safe, coded as DarkSystem PHP code method.
