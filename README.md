# Features:
- DarkSystem is **# 1** about speed & no-lag. (We think so)
- Loads chunks region-to-region. It uses less CPU resources & loads chunks fast.
- MobAI Support (So much animals and mobs can move & attack) (Support Attacking Movement)
- Smooth Movement (Players does not glitch or go down (if not 1.2 :D) while moving and does not throw back.)
- MCPE 1.2 Support (DarkSystem is compatible with MC: Bedrock Edition/Better together update)
- Auto Updater (This is automatically updates DarkSystem from GitHub.) (!!!Not implemented yet!!!)
- More Biomes & Advanced Generator (Support more biomes than others, loads level fast)
- Ender Biome Support (No description :D)
- Based on **old** PocketMine-MP for better performance and stability.
- Extended Plugin API (It is an api called as DarkAPI :D lol) (Support Compound & CompoundTag etc.)
- If you want to a cool and safe (dont forget 'fast' :)) server use DarkSystem! (Slogan by null) (lol)
- Support **PIZZA!** (/givepizza [player] | If you write only /givepizza, gives pizza everyone. NOTE: Our pizzas does not contain harmful substances lol :D) (Pizza mark can be changed from advanced config.)
- Colored & Clean Console (Console is really so clean, does not send junk messages like plugin enabling, XBOX offline mode warn. etc.)
- AntiForceOP (Hackers cannot access to OP command, you are in safe :))
- Floating Text as Entity (On DarkSystem, floating text is not a particle, it is an entity. So it blocks floating text hack or others. Also dissappearing of floating text is impossible.)
- Auto Lag Cleaner (How does it works? It automatically removes items and arrows from ground without occuping CPU.)
- CustomUI (Allows to create fully customizable menus, can be added by /addui) (only +1.2)
- /addui Command (You can easily test CustomUI's with this) (/addui {player} {type:shop/alert/image/slider/dropdown/input/mix})
- Fully Turkish Language (DarkSystem Support %79 Turkish Language. How to set language to Turkish? Simple, choose language to **tur** on set-up wizard. After set **language:** to **tur** on **pocketmine.yml**)
- MultiVersionÂ® support (**What is this?** We support **1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.2.x** versions of Minecraft (PE) Bedrock Edition)
- Always up-to-date. We always add new block, items to DarkSystem. You can find new things here when out.
- No junk tasks/threads on background. Anything cannot occupy the CPU resources and performance.
- Zoom Support (indev) (Maybe useful for PvP servers. Simply write /zoom.)
- World Teleporting (/world) (You can teleport to another world without a plugin, only with a simple command!)
- TextUtils (Idea from MiNET, Code taken from Turanic. Allows to create more beautiful texts. Example, **TextUtils::center($message)** makes message in center.)
- BlockLauncher join Blocking (indev) (If you hate hackers, this is for you. How to use? It is fully automatic. But not implemented yet. Does not work.)
- Code is clean, fast and safe, coded as DarkSystem PHP code method.
- More & Advanced Commands (/clear, /tpall, /clearchat /addui /zoom /world etc.)
- Advanced Config **(pocketmine_advanced.yml)**
- DarkBot (Virtual Intelligent Bot; Can talk, help players, move etc.) (say "hi darkbot" in-game to test :))
- Others:
- Piston (indev)
- Banner (1.2 only)
- Parrots (1.2 only)
- Rideable Car (indev)
- Rideable Horse (indev)
- Behavior Support (indev)
- Armor Stand (1.2 only) (indev) (as tile, we will make it as entity)
- Writable & Written Books (1.2 only)
